## AI Vacation Chatbot

This project is a Streamlit-based AI chatbot that recommends ideal vacation destinations and stays based on user preferences.
It takes inputs such as budget, travel dates, trip type, and (optional) preferred city — then uses OpenAI to generate personalized, realistic travel suggestions.
